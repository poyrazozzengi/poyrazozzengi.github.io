        <h3>Notes I took for Big Idea-1</h3>
     
        <p>-Collaboration topic: Emphasizes the importance of collaboration in the industry and explores effective ways to collaborate in AP CSP.</p>
        <p>-Program Function & Purpose topic: Discusses how computing innovations are developed for specific purposes. Programs take inputs that affect behavior, and statements are executed following programming language rules.</p>
        <p>-Program Design & Development topic: Guides on systematically developing programs for specific purposes. Explains how new programs are expanded from existing ones and the use of comments/documentation.</p>
        <p>-Identifying & Correcting Errors topic: Highlights that errors are natural in programming. Covers the types of errors such as syntax/runtime/overflow, how to fix them, and the use of testing schemes to ensure program functionality.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Notes I took for Big Idea-2</h3>
     
        <p>-Binary Numbers: Data is represented using bits, where each bit is either a 0 or 1. A byte consists of 8 bits. The binary system is based on two digits: "1" signifies that an electrical signal in a computer is on, while "0" indicates that it is off.</p>
        <p>-Data Compression: Lossless compression algorithms reduce the number of bits for storage or transmission while ensuring that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed. In contrast, lossy compression algorithms significantly reduce the number of bits, but only an approximate version of the original data can be recovered. Data compression helps optimize storage space and transmission time.</p>
        <p>-Extracting Information: Working with data sets presents challenges such as cleaning the data, handling missing or invalid data, and combining multiple data sources.</p>
        <p>-Using Programs With Data: Programs are used iteratively and interactively to process data, enabling users to gain insights and knowledge. Programmers can also use these tools to filter and clean digital data.</p>

        <h3>Notes I took for Big Idea-3</h3>

        <p>-Variables and Assignments: A variable is an abstraction used within a program to store values. In some programming languages, data types such as numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings are used to represent this information, and these types are referenced through variables. The value of a variable can be updated or changed. The assignment operator "‚Üê" is used to assign a value to a variable.</p>
        <p>-Data Abstraction: An index is commonly used to reference elements in a list or string by using natural numbers. Data abstraction separates the abstract properties of a data type from the specific details of its implementation. Lists, which can group together variables like numbers, strings, and more, are an example of data abstraction. Using data abstraction in a program simplifies development and maintenance.</p>
        <p>-Mathematical Expressions: An algorithm is a set of finite steps designed to solve a particular task. Algorithms can be described using different methods such as natural language, diagrams, or pseudocode. Every algorithm is composed of sequences, selections, and iterations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="unit">
        <h3>Notes I took for Big Idea-4</h3>
     
        <p>-Strings: Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming. A substring is a portion of an existing string. They are typically used for names, words, or sentences. You can combine, split, or search through strings.</p>
        <p>-Boolean Expressions: A Boolean represents either true or false. It can take a value of "1" for true or "0" for false. Boolean expressions use operators like AND, OR, and NOT. They are commonly used in conditionals and loops.</p>
        <p>-Conditionals: Conditionals are programming statements that make decisions based on specific conditions. They use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to execute different code depending on whether a Boolean expression is true or false. Example: If a condition is true, do something; otherwise, if another condition is true, do something else; if neither is true, execute a default action.</p>
        <p>-Nested Conditionals: Nested conditionals occur when a conditional statement contains another conditional inside it. This allows for more complex decision-making processes.</p>
