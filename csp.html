        <p><strong>‚ë† Collaboration:</strong> Computing innovations are improved through collaboration. Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë° Program Function and Purpose:</strong> The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or pursue interests through creative expression. Understanding the purpose gives developers a better start in developing their project.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¢ Program Design and Development:</strong> Investigating, designing, prototyping, and testing are common practices when developing a program. Giving proper credit is important when developing a program.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Identifying and Correcting Errors:</strong> Logic Error: A mistake in the algorithm or program causing incorrect behavior. Syntax Error: A mistake where the programming language rules are not followed. Run-time Error: An error occurring during the execution of the program. Overflow Error: Occurs when a computer attempts to handle a value outside its defined range.</p>

        <h3>College Board AP Daily 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.4 Notes</h3>
     
        <p><strong>‚ë† Binary Numbers:</strong> Data is represented using bits. A byte is composed of 8 bits. The binary system uses two digits: "1" (on) and "0" (off), representing electrical signals.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë° Data Compression:</strong> Lossless Compression: Reduces the number of bits while allowing perfect reconstruction of the original data. Lossy Compression: Significantly reduces the number of bits but only allows an approximate reconstruction of the original data. Data compression is used to save storage space and transmission time.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¢ Extracting Information from Data:</strong> Data sets pose challenges such as cleaning, handling incomplete or invalid data, and combining multiple data sources.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Using Programs with Data:</strong> Programs process data iteratively and interactively to help users gain insights. Programmers can use these tools to filter and clean digital data.</p>

        <h3>College Board AP Daily 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 Notes</h3>

        <p><strong>‚ë† Variables and Assignments:</strong> A variable is an abstraction used to store values in a program. Some languages provide types like numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings, which are referenced using variables. Variable values can be changed, and the "‚Üê" operator is used to assign a value.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë° Data Abstraction:</strong> An index is a method to reference elements in a list or string using natural numbers. Data abstraction separates the abstract properties of a data type from its specific details. Lists are examples of data abstraction, and they make programs easier to develop and maintain.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¢ Mathematical Expressions:</strong> An algorithm is a set of steps designed to solve a specific task. Algorithms can be represented in natural language, diagrams, or pseudocode. They are built using sequences, selection, and iteration.</p>

        <h3>College Board AP Daily 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 Notes</h3>
     
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Strings:</strong> Strings are sequences of characters used for representing text in programming. A substring is a part of an existing string. Strings are used for names, words, or sentences, and you can manipulate them by combining, splitting, or searching.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë§ Boolean Expressions:</strong> A Boolean is either true or false. It can have a value of "1" (true) or "0" (false). Boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT are often used in conditionals and loops.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë• Conditionals:</strong> Conditionals allow code to make decisions based on conditions. They use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to execute different code based on Boolean expressions. Example: If a condition is true, execute something; otherwise, check other conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¶ Nested Conditionals:</strong> Nested conditionals occur when a conditional contains another conditional inside it. They are used for handling more complex decision-making processes.</p>
  
    <div class="unit">
        <h3>College Board AP Daily 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 Notes</h3>
        
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Strings:</strong> Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming. A substring refers to part of an existing string. Strings are commonly used for names, sentences, and other textual data. You can manipulate them by combining, splitting, or searching.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë§ Boolean Expressions:</strong> Boolean values are either true or false, often represented as "1" (true) or "0" (false). Common Boolean operators include AND, OR, and NOT, frequently used in conditionals and loops.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ë• Conditionals:</strong> Conditionals enable decision-making in code. Using `if`, `else if`, and `else`, programs execute different sections of code based on Boolean expressions. For instance, an `if` statement runs code only when its condition is true.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ë¶ Nested Conditionals:</strong> Nested conditionals occur when a conditional statement contains another conditional. These are essential for handling complex decision-making scenarios.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ëß Iteration:</strong> Iteration allows a portion of an algorithm to repeat. Loops execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition, such as in `REPEAT UNTIL(condition)` or `FOR` loops. If the condition evaluates as true initially, the loop does not execute.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ë® Developing Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms can be developed from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying current solutions. These sequences of steps solve specific problems and often incorporate patterns for efficiency.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ë© Lists:</strong> Lists store multiple elements that can be accessed using their index positions. Algorithms working with lists often use iteration to traverse and process their elements, making them a critical part of data abstraction in programming.</p>
