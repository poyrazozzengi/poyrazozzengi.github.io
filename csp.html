        <p><strong>‚ë† Collaboration:</strong> Computing innovations are improved through collaboration. Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë° Program Function and Purpose:</strong> The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or pursue interests through creative expression. Understanding the purpose gives developers a better start in developing their project.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¢ Program Design and Development:</strong> Investigating, designing, prototyping, and testing are common practices when developing a program. Giving proper credit is important when developing a program.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Identifying and Correcting Errors:</strong> Logic Error: A mistake in the algorithm or program causing incorrect behavior. Syntax Error: A mistake where the programming language rules are not followed. Run-time Error: An error occurring during the execution of the program. Overflow Error: Occurs when a computer attempts to handle a value outside its defined range.</p>

        <h3>College Board AP Daily 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.4 Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>‚ë† Binary Numbers:</strong> Data is represented using bits. A byte is composed of 8 bits. The binary system uses two digits: "1" (on) and "0" (off), representing electrical signals.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë° Data Compression:</strong> Lossless Compression: Reduces the number of bits while allowing perfect reconstruction of the original data. Lossy Compression: Significantly reduces the number of bits but only allows an approximate reconstruction of the original data. Data compression is used to save storage space and transmission time.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë¢ Extracting Information from Data:</strong> Data sets pose challenges such as cleaning, handling incomplete or invalid data, and combining multiple data sources.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ë£ Using Programs with Data:</strong> Programs process data iteratively and interactively to help users gain insights. Programmers can use these tools to filter and clean digital data.</p>

        <h3>College Board AP Daily 3.1 - 3.14 Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>Variables and Assignments:</strong> A variable is an abstraction used to store values in a program. Some languages provide types like numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings, which are referenced using variables. Variable values can be changed, and the "‚Üê" operator is used to assign a value.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Abstraction:</strong> An index is a method to reference elements in a list or string using natural numbers. Data abstraction separates the abstract properties of a data type from its specific details. Lists organize items like strings or numbers to form data abstraction, making programs easier to develop and maintain.</p>
        <p><strong>Mathematical Expressions:</strong> An algorithm is a set of steps designed to solve a specific task. Algorithms can be represented in natural language, diagrams, or pseudocode. They are built using sequences, selection, and iteration.</p>
        <p><strong>Strings:</strong> Strings are sequences of characters used for representing text in programming. A substring is a part of an existing string. Strings are used for names, words, or sentences, and you can manipulate them by combining, splitting, or searching.</p>
        <p><strong>Boolean Expressions:</strong> A Boolean is either true or false. It can have a value of "1" (true) or "0" (false). Boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT are often used in conditionals and loops.</p>
        <p><strong>Conditionals:</strong> Conditionals allow code to make decisions based on conditions. They use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to execute different code based on Boolean expressions.</p>
        <p><strong>Nested Conditionals:</strong> Nested conditionals occur when a conditional contains another conditional inside it. They are used for handling more complex decision-making processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Iteration:</strong> Iteration allows a portion of an algorithm to repeat. Loops execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition, such as in `REPEAT UNTIL(condition)` or `FOR` loops. If the condition evaluates as true initially, the loop does not execute.</p>
        <p><strong>Developing Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms can be developed from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying current solutions. These sequences of steps solve specific problems and often incorporate patterns for efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>Lists:</strong> Lists store multiple elements that can be accessed using their index positions. Algorithms working with lists often use iteration to traverse and process their elements, making them a critical part of data abstraction in programming.</p>
        <p><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Binary search algorithms eliminate half the data with each round of splitting. Data must be sorted to use a binary search method effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>Calling and Developing Procedures:</strong> Procedures allow solving large problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems. Procedural abstraction enables programmers to modify or fix procedures without affecting the entire program. Procedures often require parameters and are called with arguments. Once a procedure terminates, the program resumes from where it was called.</p>
        <p><strong>Libraries:</strong> Libraries provide pre-written code that can be imported to create new programs. APIs explain how to use the procedures in a library.</p>
        <p><strong>Random Values:</strong> Random number generation in a program can yield different results every time it is run.</p>
        <p><strong>Simulations:</strong> Simulations simplify complex objects or events to investigate real-world scenarios. They may omit details and carry a risk of oversimplification or bias based on creator choices.</p>
        <p><strong>Algorithmic Efficiency:</strong> Efficiency determines how often statements execute. Algorithms with polynomial efficiency or lower are considered reasonable, while those with exponential efficiency are not. Approximate solutions using heuristics may be required for certain problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Undecidable Problems:</strong> An undecidable problem can be solved for some cases, but no algorithm exists to solve it in all cases.</p>
