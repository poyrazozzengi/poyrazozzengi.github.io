    <h2>Work Log</h2>
    <p>Approx. 8 Hours Spent On This Project</p>
    <p>3 Major Mistakes/Fail</p>
    
    <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 2, 2024</h3>
        <p>Firstly, I opened a github repository.</p>
        <p>Then, I quickly asked ChatGPT for a template but then realized it was a bad idea to try to start quickly as I had no bacground on using github.</p>
        <p>After doing some research online and following my teachers' advices, I tried to publish my first site but I failed as I tried to publish an html code on an .md file and on a private repository. </p>
         <p> I then changed the code how I preferred and managed to succesfully publish the homepage of my site after uploading my code as an .html file and changing my repository to public view.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 3, 2024</h3>
        <p>Began working on the navigator bar.</p>
       <p>I put the other pages' names on the navigator that the navigator should travel to.</p>
       <p>The navigator did not work because I did not have any other page other than my homepage and I did not link them.</p>
         <p>I added some styling to my page from the styling section of the html code.</p>
   
    
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 4, 2024</h3>
        <p>I added new pages such as"Projects, Development On Swift, CS50 ,AP Csp, How Did I Created This Site" and did not forget to add them to my rpository as html files.</p>
        <p>From the internet I learned that I should link the navigator by not referencing to other page by visiting to its url instead I should go to that page's name.html which is on the main branch to visit that site by pressing on the navigator.</p>
          <p>Added the required info to the websites and then used ChatGPT's advices on the styling of these pages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 5, 2024</h3>
        <p> I filled out the Development on Swift page after reading the unit 1 of the book that my teacher gave me. </p>
        <p> The plain text was looking a bit off so I asked ChatGPT for better styling ideas and added one of them to the page but don't forget to change the code according to your needs.  </p>
         <p> Added the projects I did so far to the projects page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 6, 2024</h3>
        <p>Filled out the Csp page with info and notes from the College Board videos. I added a video explaining what the topics of the unit 1 were.</p>
        <p>I had some tough time adding the video onto my page but this site helped me a lot <a href="https://medium.com/@ciaranbench/how-to-add-a-video-file-on-github-pages-github-io-website-html-a2e9dd81618a"></a>
    </div>

     <div class="entry">
        <h3> September 8, 2024</h3>
        <p>Added the required html code to the CS50&CS50T page showing which weeks I did on that course. I had no problem doing that.</p>
         <p>Erased the "How Did I Create This Site" page and added the documantation to projects section of my site as an project.</p>
          <p>Currently my github page started to look a bit messy so in the next few days I am looking forward to organize all my github repositories.</p>
          <p>Re-styled some of the pages on my site as while I was trying to change some of the stylings, I messed up on some of my headers by not giving enough attention. I fixed the problem by not styling header 1 and header 2 under the same code so I seperated them and styled them as 2 different things so that some of the things on the site looked better and how it was supposed to be.</p>
